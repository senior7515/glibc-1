/* This is the generic version of the cancellable syscall code which
   basically adds the label guards (__syscall_cancel_arch_{start,end}) used
   on sigcancel_handler (nptl-init.c) to check if the cancelled syscalls
   have side-effects that need to be signel to program.

   An important contrainst should be observed when using this generic
   implementation: the __syscall_cancel_arch_end should point to the
   immediate next instruction after the syscall one.  This is because
   will signal interrupted syscall with side effects by setting the
   signal frame PC right after the syscall instruction.

   If the INTERNAL_SYSCALL_NCS macro use more instruction to get the
   erro condition from kernel (from instance on powerpc), one should
   either adjust the macro or provide a custom implementation.   */
