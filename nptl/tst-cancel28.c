/* This testcase checks if there is resource leakage if the syscall has
   returned from kernelspace, but before userspace saves the return
   value.  The 'leaker' thread should be able to close the file
   descriptor if the resource is already allocated, meaning that
   if the cancellation signal arrives *after* the open syscal
   return from kernel, the side-effect should be visible to
   application.  */
